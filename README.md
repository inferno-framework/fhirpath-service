# Inferno FHIRPath Service

The `inferno-framework/fhirpath-service` provides a persistent service for
evaluating [FHIRPath](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/fhirpath.html).
This lightweight wrapper enables applications not implemented in Java, such as
the [Inferno Framework](https://inferno-framework.github.io), to interface with
the FHIRPath in a service environment.  It is primarily being used within
the Inferno Framework to provide HL7速 FHIR速 validation services for tests.

Since this is just a lightweight wrapper around the FHIRPathEngine, most of
the functionality provided by this service is [implemented within the HL7速 FHIR速
Core library](https://github.com/hapifhir/org.hl7.fhir.core), which is
developed and maintained independently of this project.
